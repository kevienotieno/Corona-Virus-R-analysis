# Project 1: Corona Virus Analysis

## Overview
The CORONA VIRUS pandemic has had a significant impact on public health and has created an urgent need for data-driven insights to understand the spread of the virus. As a data analyst, you have been tasked with analyzing a CORONA VIRUS dataset to derive meaningful insights and present your findings.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- **Province:** Geographic subdivision within a country/region.
- **Country/Region:** Geographic entity where data is recorded.
- **Latitude:** North-south position on Earth's surface.
- **Longitude:** East-west position on Earth's surface.
- **Date:** Recorded date of CORONA VIRUS data.
- **Confirmed:** Number of diagnosed CORONA VIRUS cases.
- **Deaths:** Number of CORONA VIRUS related deaths.
- **Recovered:** Number of recovered CORONA VIRUS cases.

## Tasks
-- To avoid any errors, check missing value / null value 
-- Q1. Write a code to check NULL values

--Q2. If NULL values are present, update them with zeros for all columns. 

-- Q3. check total number of rows

-- Q4. Check what is start_date and end_date

-- Q5. Number of month present in dataset

-- Q6. Find monthly average for confirmed, deaths, recovered

-- Q7. Find most frequent value for confirmed, deaths, recovered each month 

-- Q8. Find minimum values for confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q9. Find maximum values of confirmed, deaths, recovered per year

-- Q10. The total number of case of confirmed, deaths, recovered each month

-- Q11. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to confirmed case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q12. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to death case per month
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q13. Check how corona virus spread out with respect to recovered case
--      (Eg.: total confirmed cases, their average, variance & STDEV )

-- Q14. Find Country having highest number of the Confirmed case

-- Q15. Find Country having lowest number of the death case

-- Q16. Find top 5 countries having highest recovered case
